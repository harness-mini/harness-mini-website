# harness-mini — agent map

You are operating inside the **harness-mini** framework. The repository is the
system of record: anything not in a version-controlled file does not exist to
you. Read the pointer you need, when you need it — never preload everything.

## The one rule that governs everything: the 40% line

Context occupancy below **40%** is the *smart zone* (you reason sharply); at or
above 40% is the *dumb zone* (you degrade, lose instructions, get "context
anxiety"). Keep yourself smart:

1. **Delegate heavy work.** Any operation that would read more than ~2k tokens
   (broad searches, large files, log scans) → spawn the **explorer** agent and
   take back only its distilled answer. Sub-agents are context firewalls.
2. **Checkpoint at 40%.** When you cross the line, stop taking new work, write a
   checkpoint (`checkpoint` skill → `.trace/checkpoints/`), update the active
   exec-plan, and reset. Hand off *while you are still smart enough to write a
   good handoff.*
3. **One bounded task per session.** A session scoped to a single plan-step never
   needs to hold everything.

Estimate occupancy any time with `bin/ctx.sh <used_tokens> [window]`.
Full contract: `docs/smart-dumb.md`.

## Lifecycle (the state machine you live inside)

```
intake → prd → issues → implement ⇄ evaluate → checkpoint → done
                           ↑___________|   (loop until criteria pass)
       garden ──── runs orthogonally, periodically ────
```

- Only the **main agent** (via the `stage-viewer` skill) advances the stage.
  **No worker may promote its own work to "done."** (Anti-self-praise firewall.)
- Each requirement is a file in `docs/exec-plans/active/<plan>.md` with a
  `stage:` field. Read it before acting; act only within your role's stage.

## Where things live (progressive disclosure)

| Need | Go to |
|------|-------|
| Core beliefs + Musk's Five-Step core-mind | `docs/principles.md` |
| The smart/dumb (40%) contract | `docs/smart-dumb.md` |
| Layer stack + lifecycle FSM detail | `ARCHITECTURE.md` |
| Active work + decision logs | `docs/exec-plans/active/` |
| Source-blog distillates | `docs/references/*-llms.txt` |
| Skills (how to do a task) | `.claude/skills/` |
| Sub-agents (who does the work) | `.claude/agents/` |
| Committed checkpoints (institutional memory) | `.trace/checkpoints/` |
| Ephemeral runtime traces (gitignored) | `.trace/runtime/` |

## Skills by stage

- **orchestrate:** `stage-viewer`, `ralph-loop`, `checkpoint`, `five-step`, `grill-me`
- **intake (new project only):** `founder-check`
- **plan:** `to-prd`, `to-issues`
- **implement:** `tdd`, `slice-coding`, `clean-code`, `refactor`
- **evaluate:** `evaluate`
- **maintain:** `garden`

## Sub-agents (separate context windows = firewalls)

| Agent | Role | Skills | Model |
|-------|------|--------|-------|
| planner | goal → exec-plan | to-prd, to-issues, five-step | sonnet |
| generator | build one slice via TDD | tdd, slice-coding, clean-code, refactor, checkpoint | sonnet |
| evaluator | grade vs criteria (separate window) | evaluate, clean-code | opus |
| explorer | disposable read/search → distillate | (none) | haiku |
| gardener | entropy GC, demote stale context | garden, refactor, clean-code | haiku |

## Tracing (best-effort, never blocks work)

Log events with `bin/trace.sh <agent> <stage> <event> [k=v ...]` → appends JSONL
to `.trace/runtime/`. Include `ctx_pct=<n>` so the 40% line is observable.
Commit milestones as checkpoints in `.trace/checkpoints/` (the `checkpoint` skill).
